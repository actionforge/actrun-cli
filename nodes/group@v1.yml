short_desc: A Group Node is a powerful feature that encapsulates complex operations into a single, reusable node.
long_desc: |
  By bundling a series of interconnected nodes, you can create a higher-level of abstraction to simplify your workflow.

  Additionally, the ease of sharing Group Nodes makes them valuable for others as well. By default, a group node has no inputs or outputs, they can be added as needed.

  {{graph_editor_graph('''
  editor:
    version:
      created: v1.20.2
  type: generic
  entry: ''
  nodes:
    - id: group-v1-squirrel-teal-turquoise
      type: core/group@v1
      position:
        x: 0
        y: 0
  connections: []
  executions: []''', docs=true, permission='readonly', fade=false, header=false, toolbar=false, translate=false, autofit=true, classes='h-48' )}}

  After creating a Group Node, click the hamburger menu :material-menu: of the node in the top right, or select the node and press `Shift+↓`.
  The editor will open the Group Node, and you will be presented with a new graph canvas that contains 2 nodes: **Group Outputs** and **Group Inputs**.

  {{graph_editor_graph('''
  type: group
  entry: ''
  nodes:
    - id: group-inputs-v1-black-cherry-sheep
      type: core/group-inputs@v1
      position:
        x: 0
        y: 100
    - id: group-outputs-v1-dog-purple-bat

  You can now add nodes and connect them. In order to propagate data between the Group Node and the root graph, you can drag and drop a connection onto :fontawesome-solid-right-to-bracket: and :fontawesome-solid-right-from-bracket:
