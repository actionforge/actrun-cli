short_desc: Creates a credential object containing an Access Key and its corresponding secret/password.
addendum: |
  This data node securely holds an access key and its secret/password, outputting them as a structured credential object.

  This is commonly used for service-to-service authentication, like with AWS S3.

  !!! warning "Security"
      Always use the `secret` input type for keys and passwords to ensure they are handled securely by Actionforge.
