short_desc: Stages file changes in the working directory for the next commit (git add).
addendum: |
  This node adds file contents to the index (the staging area). You can provide specific file paths or glob patterns.

  The `repo` input should be connected to the output of a `git-clone` or `git-open` node.

  ### Common Patterns
  - To stage all changes in the repository, provide a single path: `.`
  - To stage all `.go` files in the `src` directory: `src/**/*.go`
outputs:
  exec-success:
    name: Success
    exec: true
    desc: Executes if the files are staged successfully.
    index: 0
  exec-err:
    name: Error
    exec: true
    desc: Executes if there is an error during staging.
    index: 1
inputs:
  exec:
    exec: true

  repo:

    name: Repository
    desc: The Git repository object from a clone or open node.
    index: 1
    required: true
  paths:
    type: "[]string"
    name: Paths
    desc: A list of file paths or glob patterns to stage. Use '.' to stage all changes.
