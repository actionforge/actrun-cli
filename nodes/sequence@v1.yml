short_desc: Executes a series of outputs in sequential order.
long_desc: 'The Sequence node allows you to control the order of execution for different parts of your graph.


  When the `exec` input is triggered, it will execute each connected output pin one by one, in order from top to bottom.


  This is useful for ensuring that a series of operations happen in a specific, predictable sequence. You can add or remove
  output pins as needed.
