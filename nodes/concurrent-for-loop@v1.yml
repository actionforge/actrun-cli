  exec-body:
    name: Body
    exec: true
    index: 0
    desc: Executes on each iteration.
  index:
    name: Index
    type: number
    index: 1
    desc: Current iteration index.
  exec-completed:
    name: Completed
    exec: true
    desc: Executes upon completion of the loop.
    index: 2

inputs:
  exec:
    exec: true
    index: 0
    desc: Initiates the loop.
  first_index:
    name: First Index
    type: number
    desc: Starting point of the loop.
    index: 1
    initial: 0
    step: 1
  last_index:
    name: Last Index
    type: number
    desc: Ending point of the loop. Note, this value is inclusive. If the first index is 0 and the last index is 0, the node will iterate **once**. If you need to iterate zero times, the last index must be smaller than the first index.
    index: 2
    initial: 10
    step: 1
  worker_count:
    name: Worker Count
    type: number
    desc: Number of workers to use for concurrent execution.
    index: 3
    initial: 4
